## Purpose
This is a todo list application that allows users to create different todo list folders with unique names. Each folder contains an arbitrary amount of tasks. Each task has a name, due date, description, priority rating, notes, and status. All folders and tasks can be created, edited, and deleted. The application will also store user data using the localStorage. Users can also view "Today's Tasks", "This Week's Tasks", and "All Tasks". 

## What I learned
- object-oriented approach to storing an arbitrary amount of tasks in an arbitrary amount of folders
- dynamically rendering objects and classes
- data storage using JSON objects in the localStorage
