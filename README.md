## Purpose
This is a todo list application that allows users to create different todo list folders with unique names. Each folder contains an arbitrary amount of tasks. Each task has a name, due date, description, priority rating, notes, and status. All folders and tasks can be created, edited, and deleted. The application will also store user data using the localStorage. 

## What I learned
- object-oriented approach to storing an arbitrary amount of tasks in an arbitrary amount of folders
- dynamically rendering objects and classes
- data storage using JSON objects in the localStorage
